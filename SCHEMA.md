# NOMNOM Schema

The manifest items consist of two main models:
- Mod
- Artifact

Mod is the main manifest catlog item, which has Artifacts, that are versioned representations of the actual content for the game.

For Example:
- Mod Xyz.ExampleMod
    - Xyz.ExampleMod-1.11.0
    - Xyz.ExampleMod-1.10.1
    - Xyz.ExampleMod-1.9.9

This structure allows forming the following relationships:
- Dependency Chains
- Incompatibility Flags
- Add-On-Mod Relationships (such as Voice Packs for WSO Yappinator, or Tacview Asset Packs for modded content, for example)

To contribute your own Mod Manifests, please see [HOW TO CONTRIBUTE MOD MANIFESTS](#how-to-contribute-mod-manifests)

To otherwise contribute to the project, please see [HOW TO CONTRIBUTE ANYTHING ELSE](#how-to-contribute-anything-else)

For a raw overview of the Schema, please check [Validation Schema.](./ValidationSchema.json)

For full detailed overview of the Schema, please continue reading.

2. Create your own mod manifest(s) in the modManifests directory, based on the schema described above
3. Submit a Pull Request to ```main``` branch
4. Github Actions Workflow will validate the Schema and Content, then declare the Pull Request allowed to merge if successful
5. A Human will review and approve the merge if no additional issues found

## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE ANYTHING ELSE
1. Fork the repository (check fork all branches)
2. Check out the ```dev``` branch to make sure you are working on the correct branch
3. Submit a Pull Request WITH DETAILED EXPLANATION of your changes to the ```dev``` branch
4. Your Pull Request will be discussed and approved to merge if appropriate
